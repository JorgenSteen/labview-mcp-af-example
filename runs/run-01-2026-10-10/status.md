# Run status: run-01-2026-10-10

state: open            # open | closed
last updated: 2026-10-10 14:50 by the manager session (phase 00)
next phase: 00 setup, steps 4 to 8 (steps 1 to 3 done)
open items: none; phase 00 step 4 done; 00b (project) runs before 00a (conventions) so the save version is measured from the file LabVIEW writes

## Machine facts (from lvai_status at the start of each session, never from memory)

- LabVIEW: 2026 Q3 32-bit (log `LabVIEW_32_26.3.1f1`), `C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\LabVIEW 2026\LabVIEW.exe`; started by this session 2026-10-10 15:06 via lvai_ensure_labview (PID 2428, launchMethod breakaway, 42.7 s); port 57742; Nigel chat not needed; lvai_status ok at 15:08, up 44 s, dwarnCount 0
- labview-mcp: server 1.9.5-local.20261010-1430 (f9ee41d9), scripts `C:\project\claude\labview-mcp-local-plugin\labview-mcp\bin\scripts`; the plugin reconnected after the user ran /mcp at about 15:05
- LVAutoSave path: C:SERSJORGEN.STEENONEDRIVE - VIRINCO ASDOKUMENTERabview datavautosave (count 0; ensure_labview reported the store already empty)

## Traps carried forward

Facts the next brief must repeat, each by its content with its source (report file and section).

- No labview-mcp tool creates a `.lvproj` or an empty virtual folder; `lvproj_move.py --create` needs an item to
  move (skill `knowledge/labview-mcp.md`, "lvai_add_to_library"; `kit/lvproj_move.py` header). Brief 00b marks the
  project creation as unmeasured.

## Deviations and fallbacks

Where the build differs from `02-specification.md`, with why, and whether the user agreed.

- 2026-10-10, phase 00: the card's step order 6 (conventions) then 7 (project) is swapped to 00b (project) then 00a
  (conventions), because `lvai_status` reports no save version and the card wants it measured, not from memory.
  Two commits instead of one. Not asked; a harness detail, not a product deviation.

## Side effects outside src/

Files written outside `zuehlke-mcp-af-test-results/src/` and this run's folder (error-code file into user.lib, LabVIEW
restarts, projects closed), one line each with the user's go-ahead quoted and dated.

- 2026-10-10 15:06: LabVIEW 2026 32-bit started by the manager (`lvai_ensure_labview`, PID 2428); the skill's
  start routine allows it with no go-ahead (no LabVIEW was running, LVAutoSave empty). This session may close it.

## Where the next session starts

Last commit: `chore: product folder skeleton` (phase 00 step 3). Nothing is half done in LabVIEW: no
LabVIEW call has been made in this run. First check that the labview-mcp plugin is connected (the
`lvai_*` tools are listed) and run `lvai_status`; if it does not answer, follow the skill's
`session/start.md` (LabVIEW was not running at 14:44 on 2026-10-10). Then write the machine facts
above, fill the `<<FILL ...>>` markers in `briefs/brief-00a-conventions.md` and `briefs/brief-00b-project.md`
(drafted 2026-10-10, not yet launched), commit them, and launch 00a (docs-only, general-purpose agent), then
00b (LabVIEW, general-purpose agent), one after the other (steps 6 to 8 of `orchestration/phases/00-setup.md`). Defaults in force: agents inherit the manager's model,
error-code file stays in the repository, no standing restart go-ahead, never push.
